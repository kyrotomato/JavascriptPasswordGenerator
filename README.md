<h2>Function</h2>

the application allows you to generate a custom length password between 8 - 128 characters.
You have the option to choose between lower, upper, numeric, and special characters.
It has a functioning button to generate the passwords and is completely randomized

Var charpool must be an empty array or it will populate with commas.</br>
Removing 'return false' on the prompt questions will allow you to exceed length limit.</br>

<h2>Future additions</h2></br>
Planning on a copy to clipboard function so you can quickly save your generated password
